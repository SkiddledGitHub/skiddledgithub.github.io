Hey there! I'm Zenial (or you can call me Zen for short)  
  
I create mostly inefficient code (*or "spaghetti" as some of you might call it*) using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).  
  
I spend most of my time talking to strangers on Discord, listening to music on Spotify, programming or sometimes all of them at once.  
  
I'm a really *really* confusing and shy person so don't expect me to say things that makes sense or talk like a loud idiot all of the time.  
  
I am currently working on an open-source bot named [Cryotheum]({% link cryotheum.markdown %}).  
It's pretty new, has inefficient code and also critical bugs that makes it unstable.  
I will slowly but surely fix the bugs over time.  
  
Socials?  
I mostly don't use any apart from Discord. You can usually catch me online on Discord 24/7.  
If you ever want to contact me then please send me a [friend request on Discord](https://discord.com/users/285329659023851520).
